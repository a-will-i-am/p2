             <p class="white-text"> Bryant was born in Philadelphia, as the youngest of three children and the only son of Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant.[4] He is also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu.[4] His middle name, Bean, is derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant was raised Roman Catholic.[5] When Bryant was six, his father left the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.[6][7] Bryant became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian.[7][8] During summers, he would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.[9]</p>

      Rey was a Force-sensitive human female scavenger who conducted her trade on the planet of Jakku, located in a remote section of the Western Reaches, thirty years after the Battle of Endor. The scavenger was born to unknown parents and at the age of five,
      was left on Jakku, a junkyard planet littered with leftovers from a battle between the New Republic and the Galactic Empire. During her lifetime, Rey learned how to survive, becoming a gifted mechanic, pilot and warrior. She was seemingly destined
      to live out her days on a forlorn backwater world, while ignorant of the larger galaxy and its perils and possibilities. She inhabited a downed AT-AT and scraped a living through scavenging parts from ships from the battle, while hoping for the
      return of her long-lost family, from whom she was separated when young.

      Finn was a human male who served as a First Order Stormtrooper, designation FN-2187 and known to his fellow soldiers as Eight-Seven. He was considered one of the group's best stormtroopers before he deserted to join the Resistance in their struggle against
      the First Order. Having left the First Order, he took on the name "Finn" at the suggestion of Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, based on his stormtrooper designation, having never been given an actual name. After leaving the First Order, he briefly
      wielded the lightsaber that once belonged to Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker. During the Battle of Starkiller Base, he used this weapon to fight Kylo Ren but was quickly defeated and severely wounded.

      Han Solo was a male Human smuggler from the manufacturing planet Corellia who achieved galactic fame as a member of the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic. Born on Corellia, he was orphaned at an early age and taken by the pirate Garris Shrike
      to serve on his crew. He was treated cruelly, and served Shrike for many years before escaping while in his teens. Solo became a smuggler, and fell in love with Bria Tharen, though she left him due to her duties to the Rebel Alliance. Solo then
      entered the Imperial Academy at Carida, serving with distinction. He was kicked out, however, when he stopped an Imperial officer from beating a Wookiee named Chewbacca with a neuronic whip for resisting capture. In gratitude, the Wookiee swore
      a life debt to Solo, protecting him with his life and a bond of friendship formed between the two that was unbreakable. Solo became a smuggler once again, with Chewbacca at his side. Piloting the upgraded and customized the Millennium Falcon, which
      he won in a game of Sabacc against Lando Calrissian, his future ally, he became known as one of the best smugglers in the galaxy.

      in the defeat of the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War and led the fight against the First Order. She was born nineteen years before the Battle of Yavin as the daughter of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala. After her
      mother died and her father fell to the dark side of the Force to become Darth Vader, Leia was adopted by the House of Organa. She took the place of her adopted father, Bail Organa, in the Senate and helped lead the fight against the Empire.

      Kylo Ren, born Ben, was a Force-sensitive human male who was the master of the Knights of Ren, and to some capacity a commander of the First Order, approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. Born to Rebel heroes Leia Organa and Han Solo, Ben
      was trained as the Jedi apprentice of his uncle Luke Skywalker in Skywalker's new Jedi Academy. However, Ben was drawn to the dark side as a result of his obsession with the legacy of his grandfather, Darth Vader. Believing himself to be too weak
      to live up to his grandfather as a Jedi, Ben was lured to the dark side, significantly influenced by a mysterious Force-user named Snoke. Taking the name Kylo Ren, Ben left his uncle's new order behind and killed all of his fellow apprentices. Skywalker
      disappeared and Kylo became one of the Knights of Ren within the First Order. These events devastated his parents, causing Han to leave Leia and return to smuggling.

      Queen and Senator of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, Luke was raised on Tatooine and hidden from Emperor Palpatine and his father, who had recently become Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. In 0 BBY, Skywalker's life changed forever. A chance purchase of
      two droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, led to him to receive training in the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and to meet Han Solo, and Princess Leia Organa, who was, unbeknownst to him, his twin sister. Skywalker then destroyed the first
      Death Star and joined the Rebel Alliance.

      Poe Dameron was a human male starfighter pilot who served in the New Republic and, later, the Resistance during its brewing conflict with the First Order. He was born the son of Lieutenant Shara Bey and Sergeant Kes Dameron of the Alliance to Restore
      the Republic, and he grew up hearing some of the tales of their battles during the Galactic Civil War, particularly his father's. Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps and became a pilot, serving the New Republic and became the commander
      of Rapier Squadron. He grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction over the increasing tendency of the First Order to violate the Galactic Concordance, the peace treaty signed by the Republic and the Galactic Empire at the end of the war. This
      disillusionment led Dameron to defect to the Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing fighter, Black One.
